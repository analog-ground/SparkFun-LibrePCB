## Description

This is a [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org) conversion of the [SparkFun Eagle](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries) library. It does not contain all parts/footprints (yet).

## Notable differences

- Not all parts imported
- MicroMod Connector has a Standoff Footprint Variant to include the hole automatically
